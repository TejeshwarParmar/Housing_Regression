Overview
This machine learning pipeline is built to:

Predict median house values based on features like income, location, and housing characteristics.
Perform robust data preprocessing including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
Engineer additional features to improve model performance.
Use Random Forest Regressor for predictions.
Optimize hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluate the model on a test set with metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Dataset
The project uses the California Housing Dataset. This dataset contains information about various California districts, including:

Feature	Description
longitude	Geographical coordinate (longitude).
latitude	Geographical coordinate (latitude).
housing_median_age	Median age of the houses.
total_rooms	Total number of rooms.
total_bedrooms	Total number of bedrooms.
population	Population of the district.
households	Number of households.
median_income	Median income of the district.
ocean_proximity	Proximity to the ocean (categorical feature).
median_house_value	Median house value (target variable).
Features
The pipeline includes engineered features:

rooms_per_house: Ratio of total_rooms to households.
bedrooms_ratio: Ratio of total_bedrooms to total_rooms.
people_per_house: Ratio of population to households.
Cluster Similarity: Measures similarity to cluster centers based on geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude).
Pipeline Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (median for numerical, most frequent for categorical).
Scale numerical features.
One-hot encode categorical features.
Add engineered features like rooms_per_house, bedrooms_ratio, and people_per_house.
Compute cluster similarity features.
Model Training:

Use Random Forest Regressor as the predictive model.
Optimize hyperparameters (n_clusters, max_features) using RandomizedSearchCV.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on a test set using RMSE.
Display the top 10 most important features.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize the number of clusters in cluster similarity.
Adjust the maximum number of features considered for splits in the Random Forest.
